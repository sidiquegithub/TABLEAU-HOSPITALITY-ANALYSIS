# TABLEAU-HOSPITALITY-ANALYSIS :hotel:

In this project, I created measures and tables in Python , which were then stored in Excel files :file_folder:. These Excel files were subsequently used to create a Tableau dashboard :bar_chart:.

This project is a continuation of the hospitality analysis done earlier. You can access the earlier work [here](https://github.com/sidiquegithub/HOSPITALITY-PROJECT).

## Measures Created Using Python :page_with_curl:
The measures created include **Total Booking**, **Total Capacity**, and the **Occupancy Percentage** for each property per week, as well as aggregated for each week separately.

See the Python code [here](https://github.com/sidiquegithub/TABLEAU-HOSPITALITY-ANALYSIS/blob/main/CODE/Untitled.ipynb).
