# TABLEAU-HOSPITALITY-ANALYSIS


In this project, I created measures and tables in Python, which were then stored in Excel files. These Excel files were subsequently used to create a Tableau dashboard.

This project is a continuation of the hospitality analysis done earlier. You can access the link here.

## Measures Created Using Python
The measures created include Total Booking, Total Capacity, and the Occupancy Percentage for each property per week, as well as aggregated for each week separately.
